This project is a website that is meant to act as an assistive tool for students, with a couple of features.
The first feature is a teacher rating system. Halton students can give reviews and ratings for their class teachers which other students can view. This allows students to decide whether they want to take a particular course depending on the teacher who is teaching it.
Additionally, students have access to a mentor or tutor lookup, allowing them to seek guidance if they want to. Alternatively, students have the option to apply to be a tutor or mentor to their peers.
Students can also maintain a personal portfolio to keep track of achievements and academics. They can use this portfolio to show off to potential employers or universities.
Plans for the future include requesting HDSB for a list of their teachers so that we can add them to our database and adding a verification system to registered accounts and mentor and tutors.
